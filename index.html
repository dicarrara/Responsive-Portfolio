                  <p>Hi! My name is Diana and my biggest weakness is to write in English. Well to write something understandable in English. So this part will be re-write with professional help.
                  But for right now let me tell you a little bit about myself.
                  <p>I was born and raised in Russia. Got a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics and Business management.
                     I left my home country the same day I got my diploma, July 12th, 2011 and never lived in Russia since.</p>
                  <p>For the last 8 years I experience something priceless: met 10 people who changed my life, ate 6 cockroaches, tried durian (no more), saw Angkor Wat, met people 
                      who lost all their family during Pol Pot period in Cambodia. Swam with sharks in Indonesia. 
                     Lived on 4 miles long island. Finaly learned English. Worked as a marketing manager for a huge tea company in Vietnam. 
                      Scuba dive 216 times. Donated all my savings and finally moved to USA.</p>
                  <p>And now I am here learning how to code my bright future. </p>
